 # iterated-prisoners-dilemma
Created an analysis tool for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.

An initial "population" of various strategies plays the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, and successive generations are created according the fitness of each member.
  
Basically, strategies compete. Better strategies reproduce more succesfully. Repeat. Plot.<br /><br />

*Simulations with identical settings may produce hugely varying results (especially with smaller population sizes or rounds) due to the probabilitic nature of the breeding mechanism. Nitty gritty details can be read [here](./evolution-ipd.pdf).*
